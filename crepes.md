Ingredients

1 cup flour
1/2 cup water
2 1/2 tablespoons sugar, This is optional, for dessert crepes.
2 eggs
3 tablespoons butter
3/4 cup milk

Directions

1. Combine all of the ingredients together in a bowl.
2. Once every thing is mixed bang the bowl on the cabinet to get the air bubbles out. You can also let the batter sit in the fridge for an hour.
3. Heat a small non-stick skillet and grease with butter, oil, or non-stick spray.
4. Pour about a tablespoon of batter into the center of the pan and swirl it around so the batter covers the entire surface.
5. Cook for 30 seconds and then flip the crepe, being careful not to fold it.
6. Cook the crepe for 20 more seconds and then put it on a flat plate or cutting board to cool.
7. Continue making crepe this way until all the batter is gone.
8. Once the crepes are cool you can stack them and they won't stick together.
9. Put anything you like into your crepes, meat, fruit, cheese and then eat!
