![image of spring rolls](https://i.imgur.com/gbfkRjw.jpg)

## Ingredients

1. Spring roll rice paper wrappers*
2. Dry "vermicelli" noodles either rice noodles or bean thread/glass noodles.
3. Cooked protien, either pork belly, shrimp, chicken breast or maybe tofu
4. Romain Lettuce
5. Thinly sliced vegetables such as carrots, cucumber, bell pepper, etc
6. Bean sprouts
7. Green onion
8. Fresh cilantro and/or mint and/or basil leaves

## Instructions

1. Soak the noodles in hot water until they are reconstituted and clear. Then put them
   into cold water.
2. Fill a pie pan or plate with hot water and dip a wrapper into the water so it
   softens. Should only take maybe 15 seconds.
3. Lay the wrapper down on a flat surface and lay your fillings down on the
   lower one third of the wrapper. Do protein, lettuce, nooodles and then the other
   fillings and last lay a sprig of green onion down the center. You don't need
   a lot of filling, just 2 finger width amount. If you put too much the wrapper
   will tear.
4. Roll the wrapper forward, fold in the sides, then roll the wrapper completely
   closed. You could wrap a second wrapper around the first if you are going to
   travel with them.
5. Repeat for the rest of the rolls.


*I like Rose Bahn Trang and Three ladies - Ba Co Gai brands as they are thicker
  and don't tear as easily.

## Nuoc Cham - Dipping Sauce
