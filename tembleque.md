2. 1/2 can of coconut cream (8oz) (more if you want it sweeter)

   it will overpower the coconut)

2. Mix the corn starch into the liquid while everything is still cold.
3. Turn the heat on low and stir constantly until the pudding thickens.

To serve flip the pudding bowls onto a plate to remove the pudding, then 
sprinkle cinamon on top.
