## Huevos Habaneros

Cuban style baked eggs, it goes great with a slice of toast.

### Ingredients

* Sofrito (you can substitute salsa, but its not quite as good)
* 4 eggs
* Shredded cheese (I like munster or gruyere)
* butter

### Directions

* Pre-heat oven to 350 degrees
* Pour the Sofrito into a pie pan or ramekin. It should be about a centimeter thick.
* Break the eggs over the sofrito, try not to bust the yolks
* Put dabs of butter or oil on the eggs.
* Bake the eggs for 8 minutes or until the whites are cooked but the yolks are still a little soft.
* Sprinkle shredded cheese over the eggs. Bake a half minute more until the cheese is melted.
* Condiments: You can put some Tabasco sauce on top or Fresh Cilantro.
