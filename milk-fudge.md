Indian Milk Fudge, aka Penda/Pera
========

This is an indian dessert made from milk that has a texture similar to fudge. I
got this recipe from Raihanas Cuisines over on !(https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoq4cyttGVBzqB5oDtSQsBA)[youtube].

Ingredients
-----------

* 2 cups Powder Milk
* 1 14 oz can of Condensed Milk
* 1 stick Butter (1/2 cup)

Mixins:
* 1 tsp powder cardamom,anise seed/cinnamon/ginger/whatever spices you want
* 1/2 cup total of nuts/chocolate chips/dried fruit, etc

Instructions
------------

1. PUt butter and condensed milk into a bowl and microwave for 30-40 seconds to
   soften the butter.
2. Add the milk powder and any spices or mixins you want and mix.
3. Microwave the bowl for 1 min and then stir.
4. Microwave in 1 min increments stiring each time until the mixture forms a
   ball when stired instead of stickign to the sides of the bowl.
5. Mix vigourously and then let it cool to a tempurature where you can handle
   it.
6. Take peices of dough and shape it into balls or whatever shapes you want.
7. Let the dessert cool completely. It freezes well if you want to make ahead.
